margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>This book uses 12 chapters to introduce the
basic concepts and logic of programming from scratch, as well as the most
commonly used structured data and its operations, including big data processing
methods and statistical drawing. These contents cover all aspects of routine
programming, and the knowledge reserve for daily data processing is enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>However, this book focuses on the content
related to the conceptual knowledge points, and does not introduce the use
methods of various functions and options in detail. If you want to make the data
processing at work more convenient, you need to practice more, especially be
familiar with various common library functions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Due to the lack of time, there are no
exercises attached to this book. You can go to the &quot;RaqForum&quot; of
Raqsoft company to consult materials. There are also rich exercises, course
videos, reviews and comments and other materials. After this book, we will also
write a set of routine sets for workplace data processing, classify and compile
the common data problems encountered in daily work, and put them in RaqForum
for reference, including table merging, splitting, extraction, summary,
transformation and many other aspects. You are welcome to follow the progress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Although many daily tasks can be completed after
learning this book, this book is only a foundation for professionals. However,
with these foundations, it will be easier to learn other programming languages.
In particular, the structured data operation introduced in this book is very
comprehensive. After understanding these contents, it is very easy to learn SQL
and engage in database application development. The computing power of SQL is
only a subset of SPL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>You can also continue to focus on SPL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>SPL is not only a programming language for
non-professionals, but also suitable for programmers to act as a computing
engine in application software development. With the help of SPL, the
application architecture and development efficiency will also be greatly
improved. We will also sort out a set of application-oriented routines and put
them in RaqForum, including non-database-source operations, cross database
operations, simplified SQL and mathematical calculations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, SPL is also a professional big data
computing language, which can write more concise code with far better
performance than the traditional data warehouse (SQL is very weak in this
aspect). This requires in-depth study of high-performance algorithms, which is
not easy. RaqForum already has corresponding courses and many examples, and we will
reorganize these materials into a book in the future.</span></p>
