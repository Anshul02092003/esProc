lang=EN-US>Compared with SQL on conventional relational database, the algorithms
implemented in SPL can often improve the performance several times or even a
hundred times. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As a programming language, SPL
theoretically would not be faster than SQL. The reason why SPL actually runs
faster is that it can implement the high-performance algorithms that SQL cannot
implement. If a computing task has already adopted the best algorithm when it
is implemented in SQL, rewriting it in SPL will not run faster. However, there
are too many high-performance algorithms that are hard to be implemented in
SQL, as long as the code is somewhat complex, it is almost certain that we will
be able to find the points that can change the storage scheme and algorithm so
as to optimize the performance. For more than ten scenarios we have performed,
we could always find certain points to improve every time, in this case, rewriting
in SPL can effectively improve the overall performance. Of course, coding in
C/C++ or Java may also get a higher performance, but the development efficiency
is too low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It needs to be noted once again that each
algorithm in this book has its own scenario to which it adapts; and even some
algorithms cannot be used at the same time due to certain contradictions
between them, therefore, the algorithm needs to be selected according to
practical situation. We have been emphasizing that we should first fully understand
task¡¯s objectives and data characteristics, and then design an optimization scheme
according to actual conditions. Moreover, the big data computing task in
reality does not simply correspond to the algorithm presented in this book one
by one but a comprehensive task, and hence we should use these basic algorithms
in an appropriately combined manner to cope with real task. Consequently, it is
more important to learn the analysis methods.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Due to space limitations, this book does not
give all examples and tests. If you are interested in learning more test
examples and codes, go to Raqforum to find them.</span></p>
