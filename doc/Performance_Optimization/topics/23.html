</span></span></span><span lang=EN-US>Merging multi indexes</span></h2></div>
	<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the previous sections, we explained that
multiple indexes cannot be used at the same time. After establishing indexes
for two fields respectively, only one index can be used in the joint condition
query for the two fields, and the conditions of the other field still need to
be traversed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In fact, this statement is not always true.
Some optimization of index query algorithm can still make multiple indexes work
together to a certain extent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For the convenience of narration, we record
the record set satisfying x as S(x). Assuming that there are indexes for fields
A and B respectively in the table, we need to find S(A==a &amp;&amp; B==b).
Using the index of A can quickly locate S(A==a), but if we want to find the
records belonging to S(B==b) from them, we can't use the index of B any more. And
vice versa, we can use the index of B to quickly find S(B==b), but we can't
continue to use the index of A for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Generally, the physical positions of
records stored in the index are also ordered, that is, in the index of A, the
physical positions of records stored in S(A==a) are sorted from small to large;
B's index is similar. This is easy to meet when building an index, or even
naturally, because the original order of members with the same value is
generally not changed during sorting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Using this, we can use the indexes of A and
B at the same time when searching S(A==a &amp;&amp; B==b).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The process is not complicated. Use the
index of A to obtain the cursor based on S(A==a) and use the index of B to obtain
the cursor based on S(B==b). Both cursors are orderly for the physical position
of records. Then, we can use the merge algorithm to calculate their
intersection to get S(A==a &amp;&amp; B==b). This is equivalent to traversing
both S(A==a) and S(B==b) once, and both indexes can be used at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, this algorithm does not
necessarily have more advantages in complexity than traversing and calculating
whether B==b is true in S(A==a), because the latter only needs to traverse one
set of S(A==a), while the previous algorithm needs to traverse two sets of S(A==a)
and S(B==b).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The advantage of this method is in practice.
To get the intersection using merging, there is no need to read out the records
of the original data table to calculate whether B==b is true, just compare the
index. The index blocks may already be stored in memory, or even in external storage,
they are stored continuously, only have two columns (to-be-searched key and
physical position) and in row-based storage format. The reading performance is
much better than the original dataset with multiple fields, discontinuous
storage and columnar storage. In this way, the performance of merging and
comparison will be better than that of reading records and then doing judgment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If we choose the smaller one of S(A==a) and
S(B==b) as the criterion to merge the larger one, we can stop merging as long
as the smaller one has been traversed, and the members in the larger one that
have not been traversed can be abandoned. In this way, the total number of traversing
will not be very large. When building an index, we can usually know the number
of records of S(A==a).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course, this method is also applicable
to the case where there are conditions on more fields.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This mechanism has been implemented in SPL.
For multi field conditions written on the cursor, such as A==a &amp;&amp; B==b
&amp;&amp; ¡­, SPL will automatically find the available indexes and merge them
without programmer intervention.</span></p>
