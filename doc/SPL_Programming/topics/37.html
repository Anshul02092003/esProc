margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>From this chapter, we begin to learn the tabular
data and its processing methods that we deal with every day in our daily work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>In the previous example of merging Excel
files, we have seen this kind of table:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:7.8pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>The first row is the title, explaining what
is stored in each column. Each row is an item of data, which may correspond to
a person, an organization, an order, an event. ¡­</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>This kind of data has a professional term,
which is called <b>structured data</b>. This is the most common data type in
modern data processing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>The data of the whole table is referred to as
a <b>data table</b>, in which each row (except the title) is called a <b>record</b>,
the column is called a<b> field</b>, and the string in the title is called a <b>field
name</b>. There are 9 records in the visible part of the above table,
corresponding to row 2 to 10 of the Excel; There are also six fields. The field
names are ID, Company, Area, OrderDate, Amount and Phone. Field names are
different from each other and can uniquely identify a column. These fields
(including name and order) are called the <b>data structure</b> of the data
table, or <b>structure</b> for short.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Structured data is data with data structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>A2:F9 in the table is the data in the data
table. We will say what is the value of a field of a record. For example, the
ID field of the second record is 10248, and the area field of the eighth record
is &quot;Center&quot;. Each field of each record in the data table will have a
value.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Note that only fields in the data table have
names, and records have no names. We will talk about how to identify and
distinguish records later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>There can be various data tables, and the
data structure of different data tables can of course be different. A data
table must have a set of data structure, and there can only be one. Sometimes
we also say the record structure, which means the structure of the data table
where the record is located.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Because structured data is often presented in
the form of this row-column style table, we will also intuitively call records
and fields <b>rows</b> and <b>columns</b>. This is a common term in the
database industry, not a popular term invented in this book. Even, sometimes
there are no obvious rows and columns when the data table is presented (we will
talk about such an example soon), people still use the terms row and column to
represent record and field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Structured data in the form of tables is very
common in reality, and most readers will have this experience. It is not
difficult to understand the concepts of records and fields by looking at a
table. We won't give more examples here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>However, structured data is not always
presented in the form of the above table, it may also be something else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>For example:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:7.8pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=572 height=183
src="SPL_Programming.files/image089.jpg" v:shapes="Í¼Æ¬_x0020_12"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>The data from row 5 can be regarded as a data
table, but what are the fields? It seems that the contents in row 3 and 4 are
the field names, but the string with a space in the middle, Item Code, is
usually not suitable for the field name (in fact, SPL supports it, but it is
rarely used, and this book does not intend to cover it), and it is unclear
whether the field names in columns F and G on the right are the contents of F4
and G4.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>In fact, the contents of row 3 and 4 here can
only be regarded as a description of the fields. The real data structure
(mainly the field name) is not necessarily the content of the title row seen in
the table, but can also be described and set separately.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>There is also this form:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:7.8pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=386 height=410
src="SPL_Programming.files/image090.png" v:shapes="Í¼Æ¬_x0020_27"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>This is no longer in the form of row-column
table, but it can still form a data table with 2 records. The fields can be ID,
Name, Sex, Position, Birthday, Phone, Address and Postcode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>So, what is structured data and data table?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Look at the above examples. The data in the
same Excel describes the same kind of things, such as a person, an order, etc.
These things have the same attributes. For example, people have common
attributes such as Name,Sex,Birthday, and orders also have common attributes
such as customer, date and amount. Each thing is a record, and these attributes
are fields. A batch of things with the same attributes constitute a data table,
that is, the data table has multiple records and fields.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Data table, record and field are abstract
concepts, which essentially correspond to something and its attributes. They are
not the same as the Excel table. The data table does not have a fixed rendering
style that must be observed, but for easy recognition, it is usually rendered
as a row-column table and filled with field names in the title.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>For the data in Excel table, as long as the
attributes used to describe a certain kind of things can be extracted, and if
there are multiple similar things with the same attributes, it can be
considered as structured data. As for what the title content of the table is,
whether there is a title, or even whether the table is in row-column form, it
is not an important factor. The key is only whether a class of things with
(common) attributes is described.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Look at another table:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:7.8pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US
style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0 width=571 height=212
src="SPL_Programming.files/image092.jpg" v:shapes="Í¼Æ¬_x0020_19"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Can we find structured data from here? In
other words, can we extract things described by attributes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Yes, but there are two data tables here. The
first is in the upper part, describing the basic information of an employee,
and the fields include Name, Sex, Birthday, Nation, IDCard, ¡­; The second is in
the lower part, describing the employee's family members, and the fields
include Name, Relation, Workplace, Phone. Employees themselves and family
members are two different things with different attributes. A data table can
only have one set of data structure and can only describe one kind of things.
To fully describe the information of an employee, two data tables (employee and
family members) are required.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>There is another case like this:<span
style='mso-no-proof:yes'></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;
margin-bottom:7.8pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US><img border=0 width=630 height=257
src="SPL_Programming.files/image094.png" alt=imagepng v:shapes="_x0000_i1104"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>This looks like a row table, and it should be
easy to extract structured data. But what is the data structure?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Simply put, we can take each column as a
field name, that is, Type, West, East, ¡­. This is indeed a method, but it is
not convenient. The computing ability of structured data in the direction of
rows and columns (records and fields) is different. When we want to calculate
the sum of various regions, it is troublesome to list the fields one by one,
while the statistics on records is much easier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>In order to facilitate statistics, for this
cross table, we usually design a data table with three fields: Type, Area,
Amount. In this way, the statistics in both directions will be relatively
simple, and if necessary, the table can be displayed in another way. For
example, put Area on the row and Type on the column, which does not affect the
data structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>However, to design the structure like above
is not inevitable. It should be determined according to the calculation
objectives of the next step. Sometimes it is still designed as Type, West,
East, ¡­, which will be more convenient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>To find out structured data from chaotic
tables, we call this work <b>structure analysis.</b> It is not a very obvious
and easy task. We need to design a reasonable data structure according to
different conditions and objectives. Structure analysis is also a very important
work. If the data is not structured, it is difficult to implement further
calculation, and the data that cannot be calculated is meaningless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>Of course, structured data is not always
stored as Excel files (conversely, the data stored in Excel is not always
structured data). In fact, the most structured data is stored in the database.
However, the knowledge of database is too professional to be covered in this
book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:7.8pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>In daily work, in addition to Excel files,
text files are also commonly used to store structured data. There are two
common formats: txt and csv. Text files usually correspond to one record per
line. Usually, the first line will be the title, usually the field names. The
columns of txt files are separated by tabs(\t), while csv files are separated
by commas.</span></p>
