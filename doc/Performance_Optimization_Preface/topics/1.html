	<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The technical
essence of big data is high performance. With sufficient performance, big data
analysis can be truly implemented.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Performance
optimization should be implemented under limited hardware conditions. Software
cannot change the speed of hardware. What we can do is to design algorithms
with lower complexity to reduce the actual amount of computation, and naturally
we can obtain higher computing performance.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Some big data
algorithms have good adaptability and can work in all cases, but they are
usually more conservative and difficult to obtain high performance. In order to
reduce the amount of calculation, we should carefully study and make use of the
characteristics of data and tasks, and design appropriate storage schemes and
calculation methods according to actual conditions.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The content
of this book is to describe applicable storage schemes and optimization
algorithms for different scenarios and objectives. After programmers are
familiar with the principles and application prerequisites of these basic
algorithms, they can flexibly combine and use them to solve high-performance
problems in business. After understanding these algorithms and features, you
can also make great progress in the technical selection and understanding of
big data products.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
algorithms in this book are mainly oriented to structured data calculation,
involving operations such as search, filtering, grouping, sorting and join.
These are the basic contents of big data calculation and the most common tasks
in data analysis and calculation.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This book
does not just simply list and summarize the algorithms in history, many
algorithms and optimization technologies are written in the book for the first
time in the industry. This book not only discusses high-performance algorithms
in theory, but also involves technical means that have no special advantages in
complexity but can improve performance in engineering practice.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This book is
not for beginners. It has certain professional requirements for readers:</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>1) Master
various operations of relational database and SQL. The meaning of these
operations will not be explained in this book.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>2) Understand
the knowledge equivalent to the data structure course of university computer
major, and the relevant concepts will be directly cited.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>3) Understand
the basic knowledge of algorithm complexity analysis.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>4) It is
better to be familiar with C/C++ or Java programming language, memory
management mechanism of operating system and basic LAN.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The principle
and process of some algorithms are cumbersome and difficult. Application
programmers do not have to master them. You can also use them as long as you
understand the adaptive conditions of the algorithms and are familiar with the
application code examples.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This book
will use SPL to write application code examples, and directly use SPL data
types and syntax to describe calculation objectives, which requires readers to
understand in advance. Readers with SPL knowledge can easily convert these
terms into the corresponding vocabulary of other programming languages.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>SQL is the
most commonly used structured data operation language, but it is too rough to
apply most of the optimization algorithms in this book. Java, C/C++ and other
programming languages still lack the necessary concepts of structured data
operation, and to define them from the beginning will take too much length of
the book. Moreover, although they can implement and apply these algorithms, the
code will be quite long and too much energy will be consumed in details.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>SPL may be
the only programming language in the industry that can apply these algorithms
without too cumbersome. After understanding the mechanism of these algorithms,
you can also implement them by yourself in Java, C/C++ and other programming
languages, and get better performance.</span></p>
