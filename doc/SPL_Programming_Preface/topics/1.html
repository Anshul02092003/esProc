	<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Programming,
like driving, has increasingly become a basic skill of modern people. There is
no need to say the benefits of mastering programming skills and being able to
use programming to deal with problems in daily work and life.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>However, at
present, almost all the programming languages in the IT field are designed for
professionals, and they set a threshold too high for employees in other job
positions to learn and master in daily work. This also indirectly leads to the
difficulty of finding a book about programming for this kind of people and
putting what they have learned into practice.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In fact, it
is not difficult to understand the basic concepts and logic of programming.
With an appropriate programming language and book tutorials, programming can
become a skill that most people can master like driving.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This book
hopes to help this process.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The content
of this book can be divided into two parts.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The first
part is the foundation, which introduces the basic concepts of almost all
programming languages. After understanding these knowledges, you can quickly
grasp the key content and master a new language. However, only learning these
contents, you can only handle some arithmetic problems that you almost never
encounter in your work, and you can¡¯t apply what you have learned.
Nevertheless, these contents are still necessary as a basis.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The latter
part is about the most common structured data and its processing methods in
daily work. After obtaining these knowledges, you can handle the tasks of
tables and data analysis and so on efficiently. The content of structured data
computing described in this book is far beyond the current traditional system
based on relational algebra. Many operation types are incorporated into the
book for the first time all over the world, and mastering these operations is
very important for structured data processing.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This book is
not for professional programmers who have an in-depth understanding of
programming. It does not involve professional contents such as object orientation,
event driven, framework and so on. Most of the knowledge here can be understood
and mastered by beginners, but a small amount of content is relatively
difficult. The part marked with * in the section name can be used as optional
reading content to deepen the understanding of programming. It doesn¡¯t matter
if you skip it and it won¡¯t affect the learning of other parts and daily work
application.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
programming language used for examples in this book is called SPL, and the
development environment is called esProc. At present, it is open source and can
be downloaded from <a href="http://www.raqsoft.com/esproc-download"
target="_blank">Raqsoft official website</a>. The specific installation process
is very simple and will not be described in detail here.</span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>SPL is the
simplest programming language in the industry that has all the basic features
of programming and can easily process structured data computing. Other
languages are either too difficult or too cumbersome (including Python, which
is very popular at present), and are not suitable for beginners.</span></p>
