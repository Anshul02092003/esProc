	<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The technical essence of big data is high
performance. With sufficient performance, big data analysis can be truly
implemented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Performance optimization should be
implemented under limited hardware conditions. Software cannot change the speed
of hardware. What we can do is to design algorithms with lower complexity to
reduce the actual amount of computation, and naturally we can obtain higher
computing performance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Some big data algorithms have good
adaptability and can work in all cases, but they are usually more conservative
and difficult to obtain high performance. In order to reduce the amount of
calculation, we should carefully study and make use of the characteristics of
data and tasks, and design appropriate storage schemes and calculation methods
according to actual conditions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The content of this book is to describe
applicable storage schemes and optimization algorithms for different scenarios
and objectives. After programmers are familiar with the principles and
application prerequisites of these basic algorithms, they can flexibly combine
and use them to solve high-performance problems in business. After
understanding these algorithms and features, you can also make great progress
in the technical selection and understanding of big data products.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The algorithms in this book are mainly
oriented to structured data calculation, involving operations such as search,
filtering, grouping, sorting and join. These are the basic contents of big data
calculation and the most common tasks in data analysis and calculation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This book does not just simply list and
summarize the algorithms in history, many algorithms and optimization technologies
are written in the book for the first time in the industry. This book not only
discusses high-performance algorithms in theory, but also involves technical
means that have no special advantages in complexity but can improve performance
in engineering practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This book is not for beginners. It has
certain professional requirements for readers:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>1) Master various operations of relational
database and SQL. The meaning of these operations will not be explained in this
book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>2) Understand the knowledge equivalent to
the data structure course of university computer major, and the relevant
concepts will be directly cited.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>3) Understand the basic knowledge of
algorithm complexity analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>4) It is better to be familiar with C/C++
or Java programming language, memory management mechanism of operating system
and basic LAN.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The principle and process of some
algorithms are cumbersome and difficult. Application programmers do not have to
master them. You can also use them as long as you understand the adaptive conditions
of the algorithms and are familiar with the application code examples.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This book will use SPL to write application
code examples, and directly use SPL data types and syntax to describe
calculation objectives, which requires readers to understand in advance.
Readers with SPL knowledge can easily convert these terms into the
corresponding vocabulary of other programming languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>SQL is the most commonly used structured
data operation language, but it is too rough to apply most of the optimization
algorithms in this book. Java, C/C++ and other programming languages still lack
the necessary concepts of structured data operation, and to define them from
the beginning will take too much length of the book. Moreover, although they
can implement and apply these algorithms, the code will be quite long and too
much energy will be consumed in details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>SPL may be the only programming language in
the industry that can apply these algorithms without too cumbersome. After
understanding the mechanism of these algorithms, you can also implement them by
yourself in Java, C/C++ and other programming languages, and get better
performance.</span></p>
